            <h1>SYLLABUS</h1>
            <hr />
            <h2>Course Overview</h2>
            <p>The purpose of CS 165 is to complete the students' understanding of the C++ language and to indoctrinate them in Object Oriented (OO) program design. Successful graduates of CS 165 will:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand all aspects of the C++ programming language</li>
                <li>Understand the theory and practice of OO program design</li>
                <li>Have a firm understanding in working with large and complex projects</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These goals will be explored in the context of C++ using the Linux operating system.</p>
            <h2>Details</h2>
            <p>The course will be broken into 4 sections:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Using Objects. Review the procedural programming tools used in CS 124 as well as an introduction to using objects.</li>
                <li>Encapsulation . Comprehend simple class syntax and the process of using a class as a modularization tool. The primary emphasis will be defining and using objects.</li>
                <li>Polymorphism and Inheritance . Understand how to leverage the relationships between similar modules and classes.</li>
                <li>Abstract Types . Understand how to write modules and classes to do useful things even when the data types are being manipulated and are unknown.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Course Materials</h2>
            <p>The text for this semester will be James Helfrich's <em>C++ Object Oriented Programming</em>. This will be available in the university book store. If you prefer a digital copy, you may also download a copy of the <a href="https://content.byui.edu/file/2bcea375-2fd1-4982-84da-a4e11bdffc83/1/C%2B%2B%20Object-Oriented%20Programming.pdf" target="_blank"> textbook</a>. There will be additional material available through I-Learn, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Schedule</li>
                <li>Additional references</li>
                <li>Videos demonstrating many of the concepts discussed in the text</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Finally, there will be additional material available on the course Linux directory<code>\home\cs165</code></p>
            <h2>Grading</h2>
            <p>The grading breakdown for the class will be:</p>
            <table id="bh">
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Preparation Assignment</td>
                        <td>15%</td>
                        <td>30 assignments worth 2/3% each. These will be due before class begins and will hit on the main topic of the day's discussion. Each are pass/fail, most of which require test-bed to pass without error for credit. You can expect each assignment to take between a half hour and an hour</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Teach One Another Developer's Forum</td>
                        <td>25%</td>
                        <td>
                            <p>You will need to ask good questions and respond to other's questions. Points will be awarded according to the accuracy and insightfulness of the posts. Keep participating until you receive a full 100% for each activity.</p>
                            <p>If you have no questions or if there are no questions to answer, please find solutions for problems in the Problem Set. Make sure you explain how you reached your solution and why you think your answer is correct.</p>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Ponder and Prove Projects</td>
                        <td>60%</td>
                        <td>4 projects worth 15% each. These will be problem solving exercises using the tools learned in the assignments. Each project will have two component: the design (5% each) and the program (10% each) submitted through the Linux lab. The last three programs will be done in pairs.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <table>

                    <tr>
                        <td>Grades are as follows:</td>
                        <td>100% -&gt; 90%
                            <br /> 89.9% -&gt; 80%

                            <br /> 69.9% -&gt; 60%
                            <br /> 59.9% -&gt; 0%</td>
                        <td>A: Demonstrated mastery of the class
                            <br /> B: All of the key concepts and skills have been learned
                            <br /> C: Acceptable, but might not be ready for CS 235
                            <br /> D: Developing; the class has yet to be mastered
                            <br /> F: Failed to understand or complete the course</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>There will also be the usual +'s and -'s. All grades are reported on I-Learn. If you feel that I-Learn does not accurately reflect your earned grade, please discuss this with your instructor.</p>
            <h2>Policies</h2>
            <p>You may work with your classmates but all submitted work for projects and assignments must be original. Share ideas; do not share code! Assistance from a classmate should be on par with the help you would expect from a lab assistant. The penalty for copying or plagiarism of assignments might be one or more of the following: -100% on an assignment, being asked to withdraw from the class, a failing grade in the class, or disciplinary action by the university.</p>
            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p>In compliance with applicable disability law, qualified students with a disability may be entitled to "reasonable accommodation." It is the student's responsibility to disclose to the teacher any special need she/he may have before the end of the first week of class.</p>
